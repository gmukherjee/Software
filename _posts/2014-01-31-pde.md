R codes for the paper "Exact minimax estimation of the predictive density in sparse Gaussian models". numerical evaluations of the risk functions depicted in Figure 3 and for calculating the cardinality of positive support points of the cluster prior reported in Table 1, can be downloaded from [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gourab/code-l0-sparsity).
