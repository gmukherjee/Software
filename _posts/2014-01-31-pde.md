title: Cluster Prior Predictive Density Estimator
subtitle: R codes for sparse pedictive density estimation
---
R codes for the paper ["Exact minimax estimation of the predictive density in sparse Gaussian models"](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gourab/l0-sparsity.pdf). Numerical evaluations of the risk functions depicted in Figure 3 of the paper and for calculating the cardinality of positive support points of the cluster prior reported in Table 1 of the paper, can be downloaded from [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gourab/code-l0-sparsity).
