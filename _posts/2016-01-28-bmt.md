title: BMT Algorithm
subtitle: R code for the application of Big Merge Tracker Algorithm
---

BMT (Big Merge Tracker) minimizes the sample within cluster sum of squares under an $\ell_1$ fusion constraint on the cluster centroids.
The codes for implementing BMT as well as the codes for producing the numerical results in the [paper](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rssb.12226) can be downloaded from [here]
