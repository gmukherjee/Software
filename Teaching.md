All my class notes and lecture slides are available from their respective course-homes in
<a href='http://blackboard.usc.edu'><i><font face="verdana" color="teal"><i>blackboard</i></font></i></a> -- USC's e-learning platform. I usually assign online homework. Please look at the class syllabus and blackboard announcements for all other information regarding the class.
